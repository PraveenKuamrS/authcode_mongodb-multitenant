# authcode_mongodb-multitenant

"In this repository, I provide backend Node.js and MongoDB setup code, well-structured and implementing a multi-tenant database concept. Specifically, each user will have a separate database. To create a new module, I have included a createmodule.js file. Running this file will give you a clear understanding of the process.

This repository offers a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. The provided code demonstrates best practices for structuring a Node.js backend with MongoDB integration. The multi-tenant architecture ensures data isolation and security, which is essential for applications serving multiple users or organizations.

The createmodule.js script automates the creation of new modules, streamlining development and ensuring consistency across your application. By running this script, you can quickly generate the necessary directory structure and boilerplate code for new features or functionalities.

Key features of this repository include:

Well-structured Node.js backend: Code is organized for clarity and maintainability.
MongoDB integration: Seamless connection and interaction with MongoDB databases.
Multi-tenant database implementation: Each user gets a dedicated database.
Automated module creation: The createmodule.js script simplifies module development.
This repository is designed to be a valuable resource for developers looking to build scalable and secure applications with Node.js and MongoDB. The multi-tenant architecture provides a flexible and efficient way to manage data for multiple users, while the createmodule.js script promotes rapid development and code consistency."
